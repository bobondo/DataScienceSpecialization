Data Source
--
Data used here was collected in 2013 by the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones project team at Smartlab - Non-Linear Complex Systems Laboratory DITEN - Università degli Studi di Genova, Genoa (I-16145), Italy and CETpD - Technical Research Centre for Dependency Care and Autonomous Living Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (BarcelonaTech), Barcelona, Spain.[^Ref1] [^Ref2] The data was accessed from the Machine Learning Repository, Centre for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems, University of Carlifonia, Irvine.[^Ref3] [^Ref4] 

The experiment involved 30 volunteers within the ages of 19-48 years who performed six activities (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying) while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on the waist. The smartphone captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity using its accelorometer and gyroscope at a stable rate of 50Hz. The activities were video-taped to facilitate labelling the data manually.
The obtained datasets were randomly split into two: 70% = training datasets, 30% = test datasets.

Identifiers
----------
**subject** - the ID number of the test or training volunteer
**activity** - the type of activity performed when corresponding measurement was taken

Features
--
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern.
F
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
